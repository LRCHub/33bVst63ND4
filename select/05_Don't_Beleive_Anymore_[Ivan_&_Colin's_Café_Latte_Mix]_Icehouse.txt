I never counted on this
guess that's the way that it goes yeah
you used to be someone I knew
somebody I could understand but

now I don't know what to do
and I don't know who you are no
all those things I hear you say
you talk that way you're a stranger and I

I don't know where to begin
don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
and this is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

and I remember your voice
before this happened to us
and I could see and I was sure
and everything was young and new but

we lost it too many times
and that's the way that it is
lovers come and lovers go
when you think you know it just isn't true oh

I don't know where to begin
don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
and this is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

I don't know where to begin
don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
and this is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

don't believe anymore
don't believe anymore
don't know where to begin
don't want to hear it again
don't believe anymore
and this is all I know
I know I've heard it before
don't believe anymore
oh oh oh
don't believe anymore
